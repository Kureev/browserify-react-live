# browserify-react-live example

Get your dependencies in place:

```
npm install
```

Run it! :)

```
npm start
```

Your server is ready at http://localhost:8080.

You can now change anything, in, say `components/MyComponent.js` and your changes will propagate! :)

See [browserify-react-live](https://github.com/Kureev/browserify-react-live) for more details.
